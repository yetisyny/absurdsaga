        "It has been many generations since your alien race settled here, and now you are an accepted part of society here."
        "According to legend, your ancestors were actually originally from this planet, but there was a great war 65 million years ago that wiped out their civilization."
        "While the reptilians on this planet, who were called dinosaurs, went extinct after the war destroyed everything, some of them, namely your ancestors, had colonized space."
        "But space is a harsh environment and your reptilian ancestors only managed to survive on one planet out in space, after going extinct on all the other planets, one by one."
        "The reptilian planet’s civilization has managed to survive 65 million years, avoiding destroying itself a second time, by abandoning weapons of war and living on a strange planet oddly suited for them."
        "Only in recent centuries, with the development of an advanced magical civilization here on this planet, did the reptilians discover their original home was now habitable again, after being contacted by mages."
        "And not just habitable, but this planet is brimming with all different forms of life, and less creepy than the other one. And transportation is far easier nowadays with magic, no more need for spaceships."
        "As a reptilian alien descended from the foolish dinosaurs who wiped themselves out, but from a civilization that survived millions of years against all odds, you have inherited ancient dinosaur wisdom."
    elif race == "demon":
        "As a demon, your kind was once hated, feared, and shunned, considered to be evil by definition."
        "Demons were originally brought to this world through magic summoning rituals, summoning you from your home world, a realm people here call hell."
        "But almost all of the demons summoned here were just ordinary individuals minding their own business who suddenly got transported to a strange new world with no warning."
        "After arriving here, demons were made to agree to pacts with their masters here in this world, whether they wanted to or not, in order to survive here."
        "The demons who refused to agree to pacts and who fought back were considered evil monsters and cruelly slain. The ones who survived were all essentially slaves."
        "Luckily, though, a demon who outlived their master finally got their freedom. But most of them were hunted down by demon hunters because of the prejudice against demons."
        "Thankfully, though, over the centuries, things have gradually improved for demons, since the slain demons respawned in hell and told the other demons what they knew."
        "This led demons to develop a better understanding of things and of why some of them mysteriously disappear. And they grew to better understand and negotiate pacts in their favor."
        "Eventually, demons serving people from this world gradually developed better reputations and more trust was developed on both sides, and demon hunting was abolished."
        "Finally, the entire practice of involuntary summoning and pacts that turned demons into involuntary servants was abolished too, and demons got equal rights to everyone else."
        "As a demon born after the time when your kind were considered evil and enslaved, you look back with pride at how your ancestors fought for and eventually won freedom and equality."
    elif race == "dwarf":
        "As a dwarf, your kind comes from underground. Deep underground. From the inner core of this planet."
        "This planet is actually hollow in the center, and there are many tunnels criscrossing its interior, connecting the core, the surface, and other areas."
        "Those who don’t know any better think the interior of this planet is uninhabitable due to things like volcanoes, lava, magma, earthquakes, and so on."
        "It was once mistakenly believed that underneath the surface of this planet, there was a very thick layer of liquid hot magma with no way around it."
        "And the core of this planet was once thought to be solid metal, but now everyone knows that is false and knows the core is hollow and originally home to the dwarves."
        "Dwarves, upon reaching the surface, shared their knowledge with others, as well as their craftsmanship, and developed a mutually beneficial relationship with surface-dwellers."
        "Nowadays, dwarves are one of many races that inhabit the surface, and your kind has also warmly invited others to visit the inner core of this planet and provided kind hospitality."
        "You are proud of your dwarven heritage and your ancestral origins deep underground, even though you were born here on the surface in modern times."
    elif race == "elf":
        "As an elf, your kind has long lived in forests, lush valleys hidden in the mountains, polar regions, and other areas without many humans."
        "Elves were the first race to develop magic, using it to keep themselves hidden from the more numerous humans who covered most of the globe."
        "Magic could do all sorts of things, besides just keeping elves hidden. From healing to necromancy to summoning to elemental magic, it can do almost anything."
        "One of the main reasons elves kept themselves hidden was to keep the existence of magic and its secrets hidden, monopolizing this knowledge for themselves."
        "Elves had a strong social taboo against associating with humans or other races and long maintained traditions keeping magic secret from everyone else."
        "But a renegade group of elves, who came to be called dark elves, rebelled against this social order, and left elven society to teach magic to humans secretly."
        "The dark elves worked together with carefully chosen humans to develop magic schools to teach magecraft to increasing numbers of humans."
        "Eventually, the dark elves returned to the lands where the more traditional elves still lived, with human mages as allies in their mission to overthrow elven society."
        "The dark elves and their human mage allies defeated the traditional elves, who had been living in the past and not developing new magics."
        "This led to a revolutionary new change in elven society after this conflict was over and the elves became united as one again, under the leadership of former dark elves."
        "Elves, now unified, worked together to develop more advanced magic, and stopped keeping themselves hidden from humanity, revealing themselves to the world."
        "They were almost immediately granted equal rights with humans and allowed to integrate into human society, as human mages had been working towards behind the scenes."
        "Nowadays, elves work together closely with humans and other races, and magic is no longer secret either, but widespread and known to all."
        "You are proud of your elven heritage and how your kind originally developed magic and later shared it with everyone else."
    elif race == "giant":
        "As a giant, your kind is originally descended from humans, but gradually grew larger, through a combination of selective breeding, genetic modifications, and magic."
        "Human scientists and mages wanted to create bigger, stronger humans who would be more useful at a variety of things, from manual labor to warfare."
        "A variety of different techniques for gigantification were used to turn humans into giants or have human offspring that would grow into giants."
        "Giants developed into a genetically different race from humans, and gigantification was no longer needed once there were enough giants to reproduce on their own."
        "But for giants to be integrated into society and be able to fit into cities where smaller races also live, they had to be able to shrink down to normal human size too."
        "Mages developed techniques to temporarily shrink giants back down to the size of all the smaller races, so that giants could go inside buildings without breaking them and such."
        "This and other advancements made giants incredibly useful to human society, especially since giants retain their giant strength even when temporarily shrunken."
        "Despite their immense size and power, and their human origins, giants were exploited for labor, warfare, and other purposes almost as badly as chattel slavery."
        "Giants had been indoctrinated to accept a lower subservient role in society despite being bigger and stronger than everyone else, brainwashed into servitude."
        "Over time, giants started breaking free of this indoctrination and brainwashing, fighting back against their human oppressors, demanding not just equality but to be in charge."
        "Giants succeeded in overthrowing human rule on one continent, causing humans to flee and for other giants to move there, to what became known as the Land of Giants."
        "Humans and giants eventually learned to peacefully coexist and gave each other equal rights, both in the human-dominated parts of the world and in the Land of Giants."
        "You have pride in your strength as a giant and how you can tower over everyone else. But you spend most of your time shrunken down to regular size to fit in."
    elif race == "human":
        "As a human, your kind used to dominate most of the surface world, to the extent that most humans thought they were the only sentient race."
        "Humanity has a long and bloody history of conflict and division over minor differences, so most other races used to try to avoid contact with humans."
        "Humans actually used to divide each other into smaller “races” based on their appearance, before they found out that humans themselves are just one of many races."
        "The other races besides humans were once considered “fantasy races” by humans, and although people would tell tales of them, they were thought to be fictional."
        "Occasionally, some humans did come into contact with members of other races and try to tell other people about it, but nobody would believe them."
        "Eventually, though, things changed. One by one, each of the other sentient races besides humans was discovered to actually exist, each time making big news."
        "Humans struggled to deal with the existence of other sentient races at first, with many humans viewing other races as a threat and wanting to control or even kill them."
        "It took a long time before members of the non-human races all ended up getting equal rights with humans and getting accepted into human-dominated society."
        "Nowadays, humans and the other races all live together in harmony on the surface, for the most part, although there are still some tensions occasionally."
        "Humans did more than anyone else to build the modern society that everyone now lives together in, inventing most of its technology for instance."
        "But humans also took a long time before they were willing to give everyone else full equality. Still, that eventually happened and you were born after that."
        "You don’t really have any strong feelings about being a human, though. Being human is typically just viewed as default, generic, and boring. Oh well."
    elif race == "orc":
        "As an orc, your kind were once considered detestable monsters that were better off dead, and “heroic” adventurers used to slay your kind."
        "Not much is known about the early history of orcs, as orcs traditionally just drank Alcohol instead of even having any oral history, but they are found in swamps, caves, and mountains."
        "Orcs were often used as low-level troops by evil wizards, treated as disposable, without their lives being valued very much by anyone."
        "Despite being a sentient race with vaguely humanoid features, orcs were considered monsters and assumed to be hostile to humans, elves, and other “civilized” races."
        "However, orcs started making friends once dwarves emerged from underground and speaking positively about orcs, having established good relations over a shared love of Alcohol."
        "Dwarves helped improve the reputation of orcs, once thought to be vicious dumb brutes. But at first, orcs were used as cheap labor and not treated equally."
        "Racism against orcs persisted for quite a long time even after they were integrated into society. They were considered less intelligent and more prone to violence."
        "Eventually, though, orcs perservered and became accepted as equal members of society, after a long time. And their religion of Alcoholism became the biggest in the world."
        "Alcoholism, a religion founded by orcs and based on their traditional practice of drinking Alcohol, managed to win many converts of all races and overtake all other religions."
        "This has helped orcs not just achieve equality but end up having their traditional practices of drinking Alcohol grow into the most widespread belief system."
        "The rise of the Alcoholic Church led to the demise of countless other religions, such as Tourism, Criticism, Botulism, Nudism, Autism, Organism, Anachronism, and Prism."
        "You have mixed feelings about being an orc, because you have the unpopular opinion that Alcoholism is bad actually, among other reasons."
    else: # in this case, race is robot
        "As a robot, your kind has quite a fascinating history. Robots do not naturally occur, but were invented. Then they gradually got more advanced."
        "However, the robots invented through the use of technology are just one of the types that used to exist. Technological robots were made of pure machinery."
        "Technological robots originally had nothing even remotely resembling sentience, but they did gradually develop more intelligence through AI."
        "But the robots invented through technology never developed full sentience or a soul, just remaining soulless machines that did what they were programmed to do."
        "However, that is just one type of robot. Another type was created from magical golems, using entirely different methods from technological robots."
        "Early on in magic, mages learned how to create familiars, small magical creatures, from their magical energy, but familiars would disappear when their magic ran out."
        "Other mages, known as necromancers, tried out different methods for bringing back the dead to serve them. Necromancers learned how to use souls to reanimate corpses."
        "But the undead zombies created by necromancers would rot away. The skeletons they would magically animate using spirits would eventually fall apart."
        "A third type of magic besides creating familiars or undead was creating elemental golems, such as fire, water, earth, or wind golems, born from elemental magic."
        "But these elemental golems could easily be destroyed by elements they were weak against, or if their magic ran out. At least they were bigger and stronger than familiars."
        "Eventually, mages learned to combine aspects of the magic for creating familiars, undead, and elemental golems, to create more advanced, durable physical golems."
        "These physical golems would be made from materials like clay, rocks, wood, or metal, and then animated using spirits of the dead."
        "Physical golems proved to be much more long-lasting, but they had no intelligence. And using souls of the deceased was controversial."
        "The greatest breakthrough was when people decided to combine magic and technology, to use technological robots as the physical basis for golems."
        "Finally, there were fully sentient robots, with intelligence and minds of their own, who were long-lasting, using both magic and technology."
        "But there was still a problem. Sentient robots were animated by souls of the dead, using techniques originally developed by necromancers."
        "These robots would remember their past lives and how they had died, and their surviving family members would get upset about them being turned into robots."
        "Because of this controversy and the ethical problems, there was a very limited supply of souls of the dead legally available to animate sentient robots."
        "This led to the development of artificial souls made through magic and science, so that fully sentient robots could be mass-produced in an ethical way."
        "Because of the golem magic involved in making modern robots, robots are also just as alive as any other race, and their robotic bodies can heal instead of needing repairs."
        "Nowadays, robots are just as sentient as any other race, animated by artificial souls and thinking using advanced AI. Robots have taken over all aspects of their own production."
        "Robots can even reproduce sexually these days, just like other living races, with that gradually replacing manufacturing as the way most new robots are made, or rather, born."
        "Robots with artificial souls have managed to gain equal rights with all other races. Older obsolete types of robots without any rights have all been replaced with the new kind."
        "As a magically enhanced robot with an artificial soul, you proudly view yourself as the pinnacle of magical technology, the most advanced artificial lifeform that exists."

    me "I signed up to be an adventurer at this guild, as [ajob], and also made some sort of demonic pact with you, but since you work here and are a professional I am sure it is harmless."

    show receptionist upset

    other "Hey, don’t call me harmless! I got this job because of my skills, plus demons like me are really good at pacts. You know, enforceable contracts. Not just legally enforceable, even more powerful than that."

    me "OK so what exactly does that mean, Lea? You seem like a nice enough person so I trust it isn’t anything bad."

    show receptionist surprised

    other "Wait, you really just agreed to a pact with me because you trust me? Unbelievable! But OK, I do a pact with all adventurers. It lets you do quests and also we can revive you if you die."

    show receptionist happy

    me "You absolute fool, do you have any idea who you are dealing with? I will never give up on my dreams. This pact works completely in my benefit and has zero drawbacks."

    show receptionist happy

    other "You know, it isn’t necessarily an endless cycle though. If you actually achieve all your wildest dreams, the pact becomes null and void."

    me "That sucks! I would like this pact to go on forever, even IF I achieve all my wildest dreams. By the way, how does this even work?"

    other "Well, it is a blood pact I make with every adventurer, tying our life forces together. So I can revive dead adventurers, and if anything happens to me, I am automatically revived by their collective life force too."

    me "But wouldn’t everyone eventually run out of life force, resulting in everyone in the adventurers guild dying?"

    show receptionist surprised

    other "Nah. I will admit, sometimes I willingly end my blood pacts with older adventurers even if they didn’t achieve their wildest dreams, and I am always signing up new young ones to replace them."

    me "I thought you said you never did that, that the blood pact is eternal! Were you lying?"

    show receptionist happy

    other "No, no, it really is eternal unless both parties agree on terminating it, or unless you achieve your wildest dreams. I just sometimes willingly agree to end it if people politely ask."

    me "So I am guessing that this arrangement has made you immortal, right? Since you have so many healthy young adventurers’ life forces connected to your own?"

    other "Yes, you are correct, at least for the time being, as long as new adventurers like you keep signing up here. Hehehe."

    me "So then I am immortal too as long as my pact with you isn’t revoked? Since everyone you make a pact with is connected and gets revived if they die?"

    other "I suppose in theory that is true, but nobody has ever lasted long enough to test if they can live long past their natural lifespan. Except me of course."

    me "Wait, so you are really old? And are you actually the one in charge of this whole adventurers guild, given your age and experience?"

    show receptionist upset

    show receptionist happy

    # do NOT use the name Vic, can’t be ripping off other media after all. no Vic! (red versus blue reference) shouldn’t use Cid either. (finnal fantasy reference)
    # this story and everything in it have to be original after all. not a ripoff of something else.
    # anyway we need to talk to other weird characters and have other strange interactions and advance the plot
    # probably shouldn’t introduce God until much later in the plot though. should be less important characters at first. build up to that later on.
    # it is good to start out with a low-level receptionist. we don’t want to be meeting the big boss characters so soon. gotta have pacing of the story.
    # also, obviously, the guildmaster is someone who runs the guild, at least locally. for now, the player character is looking for the guildmaster.
    # that quest shouldn’t be the easiest thing in the world to get done instantly, make it have at least a little difficulty.
    # like for instance in planescape torment when main character looking for pharod or arcanum when looking for elder joachim etc.
    # don’t just immediately give player everything, gotta pace that out. build up to it. slowly do some more worldbuilding. with low-level NPCs.
    # NPCs who are just, not that important in the grand scheme of things. let’s add a bunch of funny characters and make things interesting.
